# Leak

Will turn network traffic into audio events.  A tool from ~2003 from s7ephen's private repository.

This was written back before I got old and lazy and starting using OSX/Windows. Back when I lived and breathed Linux/FreeBSD. 

Building is straight forward. ```make``` should do just fine once you've moved the Makefiles to ```Makefile```. I dont remember which one worked last, the GTK or Gnome one. GTK is probably the one that works best.

One really cool thing to try (once you run it) is port scanning your host.
Sounds like a slide whistle a little... ;-)
